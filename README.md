# MetacriticScraper

The purpose of our midterm was to build a portfolio with notebooks that collects data from Metacritic, then using the same data, analyze it for any significate information. For my chart, I compared the movies that contain certain keywords to their Metacritic Scores. 

I created a histogram chart with the help of my Professor, Ted Spence, who provided us with an example code of how to get the results. I decided to use 'Horror' and 'Comedy' as the 2 keywords to compare. 

For starters, I found that there are much more movies that contain the word 'Comedy' in the description than the word 'Horror'. The Comedy movies had a closer to normal distribution with very few outliers, meaning people generally enjoyed these movies. Majority of the ratings ranged in the 20-80 for scores. Horror movies on the other hand had a slighly right skewed range of scores, but overall a pretty evenly distributed score that was between 25-75, with the most rated at 60. This chart just shows that people enjoy both movies, but because Comedy movies had a higher volumn of data, we were able to see the normal distribution versus the Horror films.
